🎵 [Children's Choir]

## Elder Christofferson

(Flourishing societies and people)

Successful groups of people are obedient to God:

- Nephites
- Early Americas

Responsibilities and duties should trump a dominance in society that favors personal privileges and entitlement.

Non-religious people can obviously be good, but goodness comes from Christ.

### Bad actions yield bad fruit

Bitter fruits of sexual revolution:

- chilren out of wedlock
- children without fathers, with women bearing shared responsibilities
- deficient education with a lack of family
- individual heartbreak from adultery and promiscuity

"By their fruits, ye shall know them"

## Steven J. Lund

[Son contracted cancer]

## Elder Gong

Tender mercies are more easily manifested in trying times.

I can help fulfill prophecy by spreading the gospel.

## Elder Uchtdorf

[SLC sandstone temple foundations story]

Every dispensation faces hardship. But the Lord still dwells with His people during those times.

> Come, and belong

Maybe my foundations are still made of sandstone and they need to be upgraded to granite still.

🎵 How Firm, A Foundation
