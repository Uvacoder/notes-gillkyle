title: 'Effort'

Life is hard and requires effort. That idea is exciting to me when I realize what it enables. Growth happens in trials through [a refiner's fire](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3.2?lang=eng), and intense effort can mean intense growth.

> God's opportunity is man's extremity. -John Flavel

When I served a [[mission]] I found myself pushed to some physical and mental limits. It required a lot of effort but resulted in unbelievable growth in myself. I left my mission more confident, strong, mature, and optimistic.

The [[Gospel of Jesus Christ]] requires effort as well, it's not enough to say I believe if I don't follow it up with action.
