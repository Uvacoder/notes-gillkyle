I believe that Jesus Christ is the most important person to have ever lived. Choosing to live a life like Jesus lived is a noble endeavor and I intend to live like Him as much as I can.

I've found that the best ways for me to learn about Jesus are through the New Testament and the Book of Mormon. The scriptures don't contain a perfect account of events, or even an indisputable set of concrete standards one must live, but help me become a better person each time I read them. [[Religion]] is about more than just being a good person though.
