title: 'Nightly Routine'
---

My nightly routine is closely related to my [[morning routine]]. Both are related because when I go to bed affects how I'll wake up. How I start the day influences when I will wrap up my day.

My ideal routine looks like this:

- 10:30 - brush teeth, change, wash face
- 10:45 - write in journal, respond to last to-dos/messages
- 10:55 - turn off phone and leave in another room
- 11:00 - pray and retire to bed
- ...
