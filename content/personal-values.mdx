Many organizations and businesses establish values to help build a culture. This feels more necessary at a large scale, comprised of many individuals, but I find it nice to codify my own values and (even turn them into a [[code of ethics]]). Though they're a work in progress, here are some of them:

## Priorities over preferences

Alluded to in [[priorities]], some things are simply more important to me than others. My family should come before my job in decisions I make. My individual character should not be hurt to further my career.

## Micro pessimism, but macro optimism

Alluded to in some of my notes on [[optimism]], but I believe in being positive. In some cases though, I want to try to look at my life through a critical lens to be better and recognize ways to make myself a little better.

## Strong opinions, weakly held

Alluded to in [[questions]], I want to make informed opinions from study, and be open to changing those ideas when I learn more.
