title: 'Intentional'

Intionality is found overlapping many ideas I've been spending more time investigating. To me it is putting deliberate care and thought to action.

With [[minimalism]], it means using a limited set of tools for maximum efficacy, rather than simply reducing things as much as I can.

For [[habits]], being intentional means deciding what behaviors are inline (or not) with my priorities.
