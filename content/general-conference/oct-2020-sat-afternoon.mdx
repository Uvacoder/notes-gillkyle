## Elder Christofferson

(Flourishing societies and people)

Successful groups of people are obedient to God:

- Nephites
- Early Americas

Responsibilities and duties should trump a dominance in society that favors personal privileges and entitlement.

Non-religious people can obviously be good, but goodness comes from Christ.
