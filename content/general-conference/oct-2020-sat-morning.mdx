ðŸŽµ I Feel my Savior's Love

## President Nelson

Ponder a promise the Lord made, whosoever will, may lay hold upon the word of God. Feel Lord's perfect love.

## Elder Bednar

<Scripture
  title="D&C 38:30"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.30?lang=eng"
>
  30 I tell you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, treasure up wisdom in your bosoms,
  lest the wickedness of men reveal these things unto you by their wickedness, in a manner which
  shall speak in your ears with a voice louder than that which shall shake the earth; but{' '}
  <b>if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.</b>
</Scripture>

Teachers help students learn for themselves, and prepare tests for them.

Tests are essential for learning. "Prove", "examine", and "try" are used in scriptures, not "test".

Two principles to help in our examination:

1. [[Preparation]]
2. Pressing forward with steadfastness in Christ

Casualness, procrastination, and complacency are most damaging when disaster strikes.

_What I learned during spiritually/physically/mentally during the pandemic?_

## Scott D. Whiting

Focus and commit on a single attribute, and that leads to incremental change.

## Michelle D. Craig

[Happy birthday story waiting in line]

David Brooks said we need to see people deeply.

Questions to ask for positive introspection:

1. What should I stop doing?
2. What should I start doing?

I should watch out for others and care less about myself.

ðŸŽµ Come, Ye Children of the Lord

## Elder Cook

[Story of mother feeding 2 groups of strangers]

Early members were respectful both to women and native Americans, maybe because of their life experiences being pushed out of everywhere they went. Impressive they weren't bitter to strangers.

Unity is enhanced when people are treated with dignity and respect, even when they may appear different.

Unity can be improved with diversity.

## Elder Rasband

All temples have words "holiness to the Lord"

The interview lets me reaffirm my testimony and the qualities I believe in.

I really love Elder Rasband.

ðŸŽµ Have I Done Any Good?

## Elder Oakes

Our time is full of hate and anger. We will always have differences, forego anger for political choices.

<Scripture
  title="Mathew 5:43-44"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.43-44?lang=eng"
>
  43 Â¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
  <br />
  44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate
  you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
</Scripture>

Jesus even told Romans to pay their taxes to Caesar. We follow laws of men and live peacefully.

Anger leads to division and enmity. I'll care more about "enemies" if I'm willing to learn from them.

[[Love]] can be powerful, it begets more love.

ðŸŽµ Love One Another
