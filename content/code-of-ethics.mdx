title: 'Code of Ethics'
---

In order to become a more well-rounded, upright individual, this notes outlines an approach to my own personal ethical behavior and makes me more [[accountable]] to it by being recorded.

My personal decisions are and will continue to be derived initially from these two rules:

1. I will not break a commandment (unless itâ€™s one of those forbidden fruit situations)
2. I will be honest in my dealings with my fellow man

After using those two rules as a baseline for decisions that involve ethical dilemmas, they should then be made in consideration to my [[priorities]].
