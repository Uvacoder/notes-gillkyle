The Gospel of Jesus Christ is comprised of the steps people need to make to find persisting, eternal happiness. It is all made possible by the Atonement of [[Jesus Christ]].

The 5 parts of the Gospel of Jesus Christ (at least that are taught by missionaries) are:

1. [[Faith]] in Jesus Christ

2. Repentance

3. Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins

4. Laying on of hands for the gift of the [[Holy Ghost]]

5. Enduring the end and continuing to live the principles of the Gospel
