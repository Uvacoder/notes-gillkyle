> Would I try to share the gospel?

_Interesting to think about the questions in this song because of what we tend to talk about in regards to how we act when no one is around._

## Elder Ballard

World is in commotion and many people are in fear.

[ ] Pray for peace in the world.

[[Jesus]] is the [Prince of Peace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ly9xk59Qkfc) and source of all healing, which is the best way to help the world situation.

Another mention of the Sermon on the Mount about blessing enemies.

<Scripture
  title="Mathew 5:43-44"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.43-44?lang=eng"
>
  43 Â¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
  <br />
  44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate
  you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
</Scripture>

[[Prayer]]s for change have made a huge difference on the world, think about someone like Joseph Smith as an example

##

[Story of disciples on Sea of Galilee]

Jesus asked [[questions]] to teach them:

1. Why are ye so fearful?
2. Where is your faith?

## Elder Soares

Uninvited thoughts shape our desires. This is a big reason why many are called and few are chosen.

One thought can make me vulnerable, no need to dwell on anything unrighteous.

An added measure of the Spirit is promised for saying get thee hence to temptation.

## Elder Godoy

Angels are all around, like missionaries, friends, family. Everyone needs their help at some point.

## Elder Anderson
