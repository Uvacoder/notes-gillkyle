title: 'Consistency'

Being consistent is less exciting than making a splash, but feels more important to me. If someone can rely on me, and I can repeat my successes I'm set up for making a difference in other's lives.

  We become what we want to be by <b>consistently</b> being what we want to become each day.
</Scripture>

I agree that it's by _consistently_ being, one moment, one day, or one action isn't enough for real change. Repentance requires consistency avoiding sin, strengthening faith requires consistency to grow, it's woven into most princpiles of daily gospel living.
