> The most important thing in our lives is the Spirit. -[Pres. Ezra Taft Benson](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-ezra-taft-benson/chapter-12-seek-the-spirit-in-all-you-do.p11?lang=eng#p11)

I think the most important endeavor to maintain throughout life is trying to understand, listen to, and follow the Spirit. The happiest and best moments of my life have been direct results of paying attention to soft nudges and promptings to simple actions like speaking up or giving freely.

## Finding Answers

Difficult answers to problems can be found to by asking [[questions]], and the Spirit often seems to be way some of the hardest answers are confirmed. Many would refer to the Spirit as the human conscious, but I believe it's a little more nuanced than that.

Two scriptures in D&C allude to avenues that answers can be found through:

<Scripture
  title="D&C 6:23"

  23 Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have
  than from God?
</Scripture>
