> The most important thing in our lives is the Spirit. -[Pres. Ezra Taft Benson](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/teachings-of-presidents-of-the-church-ezra-taft-benson/chapter-12-seek-the-spirit-in-all-you-do.p11?lang=eng#p11)

I think the most important endeavor to maintain throughout life is trying to understand, listen to, and follow the Spirit. The happiest and best moments of my life have been direct results of paying attention to soft nudges and promptings to simple actions like speaking up or giving freely.
