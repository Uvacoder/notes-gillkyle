title: 'Love'

The pure love of Christ is "kind, meek, and lowly". I think it is just what the world needs.

[[Jesus Christ]] taught an extremely radical idea for His time in the Sermon on the Mount:

<Scripture
  title="Mathew 5:43-44"

>
  43 Â¶ Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
  <br />
  44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate
  you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;
