title: Digital Minimalism

Using only the most necessary digital tools to support my own values is preferred to a maximalist approach, where every tool possible that might help is adopted.

Inspired by Cal Newport's book, [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/), I've found being more intentional about my technology habits very rewarding.

I made excuses keeping feeds like Twitter in my life because of the bleeding edge tech updates and ideas I saw that helped me do my job better. I actually got my job through work I shared on Twitter. Those benefits don't actually outweight the mental distress and dissonance that constantly observing flame wars and fielding negative criticism caused.

A seminary teacher once told me that he wrote in his [[journal]] every day because his life felt like a soap opera when he only wrote on days of important events. Social media suffers from a selection bias when those that are posting only record the fantastical.

Analogous to digital minimalism is the idea of [[stillness]], which purports to find valuable moments of life free from distraction. By avoiding social media feeds in particular, there is more room to fill with the impactful, still moments of life.
