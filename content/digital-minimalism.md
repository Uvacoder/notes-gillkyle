title: Digital Minimalism

Using only the most necessary digital tools to support my own values is preferred to a maximalist approach, where every tool possible that might help is adopted.

Inspired by Cal Newport's book, [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/), I've found being more intentional about my technology habits very rewarding.
