I'm inspired by many people, these are some of them:

## Roger Williams

The founder of Rhode Island, a champion of freedom, a radical thinking theologian, a staunch abolitionist, an honest man who stood by his convictions, and my 11th great-grandfather.

Roger Williams makes me proud of my heritage.

## Charles (Chuck) Feeney

Chuck Feeney made a fortune and continued to live frugally, and [gave away over 8 billion dollars](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenbertoni/2020/09/15/exclusive-the-billionaire-who-wanted-to-die-brokeis-now-officially-broke/?sh=411742823a2a).

## Russell M. Nelson

A pioneering heart surgeon and president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as a modern prophet.

## Clayton M. Christensen

"[One of the most influential business theorists of the last 50 years](https://www.forbes.com/global/2011/0314/features-clayton-christensen-health-care-cancer-survivor.html)" and a faithful man. I love his ideas in [How Will You Measure Your Life?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvos4nORf_Y)

## Yukihiro (Matz) Matsumoto

Creator of the Ruby programming language. A member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and [a wise and happy individual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkh0gPf4Noc).
