There are many insightful lessons that seem unituitive, or run contrary to expectation. The commonality of these examples means that I'm probably right less often than I think. The models for pattern matching that I've built up in the world fail in so many cases, that it makes more sense to [[question]] and challenge my beliefs in as many cases as possible.

They are riddled throughout the scriptures, as well as lessons taught by prophets/apostles/leaders:

- in losing your life through service to God you can find it

<Scripture
  title="Matthew 10:39"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/10.p39?lang=eng#p39"
>
  39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.
</Scripture>

- man is [nothing in the immense and infinite universe](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2014/06/young-adults/follow-the-path-of-happiness.p16?lang=eng), yet [we are everything to God](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2011/11/saturday-morning-session/you-matter-to-him.p13?lang=eng)

- Jesus came to make the blind see, and those that claim to see be made blind

<Scripture
  title="John 9:39"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/9.39?lang=eng#p38"
>
  39 Â¶ And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see;
  and that they which see might be made blind.
</Scripture>

- Israel is made up of people not from Israel

<Scripture
  title="Romans 9:6"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/rom/9.p6?lang=eng#p6"
>
  6 Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they are not all Israel, which are of
  Israel:
</Scripture>

- our garments (or sins) can be made white by being washed in blood (of [[Jesus Christ]])

<Scripture
  title="Ether 13:10"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/13.p10?lang=eng#p10"
>
  10 And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed are they who dwell therein, for it is they whose
  garments are white through the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who are numbered among the
  remnant of the seed of Joseph, who were of the house of Israel.
</Scripture>

<Scripture
  title="Alma 5:21"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.p21?lang=eng#p21"
>
  21 I say unto you, ye will know at that day that ye cannot be saved; for there can no man be saved
  except his garments are washed white; yea, his garments must be purified until they are cleansed
  from all stain, through the blood of him of whom it has been spoken by our fathers, who should
  come to redeem his people from their sins.
</Scripture>

- ["Consecration is the only surrender which is also a victory"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1992/10/settle-this-in-your-hearts.p22?lang=eng) -Neal A. Maxwell

- [Love your enemies](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.p44?lang=eng#p44)

- The adversary [actually faciliated God's plan](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2016/04/opposition-in-all-things.p13?lang=eng) by trying to thwart it

- The Jews [crying out they have no king but Caesar](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/19.p15?lang=eng#p15) as they urged Jesus to be crucified

- champions of [[moral relativism]] claim standards are an issue of personal preference are often [the harshest critics of those who don't accept "correct thinking"](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/04/the-voice-of-warning.p27?lang=eng)

I think it's fascinating that so many lessons and examples in the world are less obvious like this, and use this as evidence for the need to observe the world carefully.
