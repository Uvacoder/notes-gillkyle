title: The value of Religion
---

There is a pervasive attitude of religion being a more primitive way of thinking. I find that unsettling because of the dysfunction we see in a society that rejects a shared truth.

CS Lewis summed it up:

> In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful. -C.S. Lewis

If the only thing that matters is "your truth" (and truth becomes relative), it gets hard to discuss hard problems that relate to it.
