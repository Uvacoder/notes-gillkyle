title: The Value of Religion
---

There is a pervasive attitude of religion being a more primitive way of thinking. I find that unsettling because of the dysfunction in a society that comes from rejecting shared [[truth]].

CS Lewis summed it up:

> In a sort of ghastly simplicity we remove the organ and demand the function. We make men without chests and expect of them virtue and enterprise. We laugh at honour and are shocked to find traitors in our midst. We castrate and bid the geldings be fruitful. -C.S. Lewis

If the only thing that matters is "your truth" (and truth becomes relative), it gets hard to discuss hard problems that relate to it.

Religion teaches you to prioritize your life according to a set of higher laws.
