[[Writing]] in and of itself is valuable, but journaling becomes a very acute version of writing that captures the rawest feelings. I'm a firm believer in journaling as a coping mechanism, a stress reliever, a sort of therapy, and as a way of defogging my mind.

Over time, I've found journaling writing so valuable I have written in a journal every night for the past 7+ years. That habit began on my [[mission]], and continued when I came home.

## Types of Journals

I started writing in a physical journal, and found it valuable. I found it lacked a few things though when I switched to a digital journal. I think a good journal has the following qualities:

- it can be searched by text
- it can be stored/preserved indefinitely
- it is available and easy to write in on a moment's notice
- it can be stored in a way that is portable

The first piece of criteria makes it easiest to obtain in digital form.

These ideas led me to making my own [open source journaling platform](https://github.com/gillkyle/sol-journal) that faciliated all of this.
