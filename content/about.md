title: About these notes
---

Hi, I'm [Kyle](https://kylegill.com) ðŸ‘‹

These notes are bi-directionally linked to make navigating them a little more like deep linking your way through Wikipedia articles.

Each page is intended to be an atomic, self-standing idea or concept that can be developed on its own, or related to other notes of a similar fashion. Notes aren't fully complete, but are instead being [gardened](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)â€”or rather, improved and nurtured over time.

Some of the places I've been tending the most thought to are in the following areas:

- impact of [[digital minimalism]] and intentional usage of technology
- value of [[religion]] in my life and in the world
- importance of [[writing]] to preserve ideas

I'm trying to first get in the [[habit]] of writing more for myself, and then will try and publish more, though you can find me other places as well.

## Other places on the web

I write down notes in more places than just these notes. A few more places you can find things I write:

- [Audio Vault](https://audio-vault.com): where I write about [[music]] as an art form
- [study.kylegill.com](https://study.kylegill.com): where I write about my study in the Come, Follow Me curriculum which includes annotations of scripture and thougths on stories from the gospel and life of [[Jesus Christ]]
- My [blog](https://kylegill.com/blog): where I write about programming and life related topics (often mixed), and longer form ideas related to it
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gill_kyle): where I post programming related demos and new technologies, how to use them, and what's exciting. It's worth noting I don't post often anymore as I've been trying to be more mindful about [[digital minimalism]] and my [[habits]]
