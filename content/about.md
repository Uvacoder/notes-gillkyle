title: About these notes
---

Hi, I'm [Kyle](https://kylegill.com) ðŸ‘‹

These notes are bi-directionally linked to make navigating them a little more like deep linking your way through Wikipedia articles.

Each page is intended to be an atomic, self-standing idea or concept that can be developed on its own, or related to other notes of a similar fashion. Notes aren't fully complete, but are instead being [gardened](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)â€”or rather, improved and nurtured over time.

Some of the places I've been tending the most thought to are in the following areas:

- impact of [[digital minimalism]]
- value of [[religion]]
- importance of [[writing]] to preserve ideas

This idea is inspired by [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), and is implemented with [Aravind Balla's work on `gatsby-theme-andy`](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy/).
