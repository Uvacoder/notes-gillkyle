title: General Conference - October 2020
---

These sessions of conference were really inspiring for me. I enjoyed repeated mentions of topics like:

- [[Love]]
- [[Unity]]
- [[Diversity]]
- [[Preparation]]

That all carried references to [[Jesus Christ]]'s teachings from the scriptures.

Another theme was of covenant people and communities that learn to become self-reliant.
