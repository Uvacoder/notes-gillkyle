According to the Book of Mormon, the freedom to choose is fundamental in God's plan.

<Scripture
  title="2 Neph 2:27"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.27?lang=eng#p27"
>
  27 Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are
  expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great
  Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the
  devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.
</Scripture>

I love that there is an individual ability to [determine my own destiny](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/thomas-s-monson/decisions-determine-destiny/).

Another favorite scripture that ties these ideas together is in the book of Helaman.

<Scripture
  title="Helaman 14:30"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/14.30?lang=eng"
>
  30 And now remember, remember, my brethren, that whosoever perisheth, perisheth unto himself; and
  whosoever doeth iniquity, doeth it unto himself; for behold, ye are free; ye are permitted to act
  for yourselves; for behold, God hath given unto you a knowledge and he hath made you free.
</Scripture>

Happiness and joy are the result of rightouse living: choosing to serve, helping the sick/poor/needy, caring for family (and so many other things). If choosing to live righteously is up to me, I can chooose to make my life full of joy, and it's my responsibility.

It's motivating that **I am the one who can make the biggest difference on my own life**.
