_(Fourth session of [[Oct 2020]] General Conference)_

ðŸŽµ O Say What is Truth

ðŸŽµ Softly, and Tenderly

## Pres Eyring

_I knew I'd be tested, I wonder if I liked the competition for tests as much in the pre-earth life._

Read scriptures, have faith, be baptized, confirmed, and keep covenants and I'll naturally come unto Jesus and be guided to safety, even when I can't see the way.

Suffering can often be the Lord trying to polish someone a little more. _This is a really positive take on what most people like to put a negative spin on_

## Jeremy R. Jaggi

Another mention of the sermon on the mount:

<Scripture
  title="Matthew 6:21"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6.21?lang=eng"
>
  21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
</Scripture>

Following Christ should be my most defined characteristic of my identity in the world.

## Elder Stevenson

...

## Wilson Tamargo

The gift to hear and receive the word of the Lord is underrated.

Asking [[questions]] and [[writing]] things down leads to righteous desires.

God wants to answer a [[prayer]] that asks to bless others.

ðŸŽµ Guide Us, O Thou Great Jehovah

## Elder Renlund

Am I doing enough? What does God require of me?

<Scripture
  title="Micah 6:8"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/micah/6.8?lang=eng"
>
  8 He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do
  justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?
</Scripture>

These things are descriptive of a broken heart and a contrite spirit, and also includes always doing well to others.

Delight in God extending mercy to others, not just yourself. I'm no better than my peers, Jesus like always gave the perfect example in this.

## Kelly R. Johnson

Pres. Nelson often talks about power. Jesus Christ has all power and it comes predominantly from Him.

## Elder Holland

How long do I have to wait for relief?

Faith filled and stress free don't go together. The stresses, feelings of forsaken-ness, pains, etc. of life are what made God divine and are also what will make me more like Him.

## Pres. Nelson

_I feel optimistic about the future, even if there is some commotion._

The gathering of Israel still moves forward. Be joyfully optimistic.

ðŸŽµ God Be With You Till We Meet Again
