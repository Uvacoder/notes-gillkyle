title: Optimism

I believe in being positive. Obviously, in a fallen world, there are poor and unfortunate things that happen, but even with those things I'm capable of appproaching them with an attitude that skews towards optimism.

## I am a micro pessimist but a macro optimist

I strongly resonated with a value from [Stripe's culture guide](https://stripe.com/jobs/culture), it states: "We are micro pessimists but macro optimists". I've tried to take that to heart and be critical of small incremental improvements, but recognize how blessed I am, how full of happiness my life is, and how good things are overall.
