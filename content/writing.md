title: 'Writing to Preserve Ideas'
---

Even if the only benefit to writing were preserving ideas, it would be well worth it. In addition to keeping a record, writing can be read by others and scale nearly infinitely to create a broader influence.

Writing also helps me process ideas easier. It's been said that the brain is a processor, not a hard drive. By persisting important ideas to RAM (only in the brain) instead of writing them down in a more permanent form, I risk losing an idea.

The more I write, the less I need to worry about remembering, because a storage medium can do it for me when the time comes to retrieve an idea. (This was a key idea that led to me creating my own [open source platform](https://github.com/gillkyle/sol-journal) for [[journal writing]])
