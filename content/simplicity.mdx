title: 'Simplicity'
---

There was a regression in spiritual truth on the world during the Dark Ages, partly in truth I think because the simple [[Gospel of Jesus Christ]] became more complicated.

Documents like the Nicene Creed don't really give me a lot of clarity, the ambiguity of the Godhead in particular is confusing.

## A lesson from science

I find Occam's Razor a very compelling parallel with the what [[Jesus]] taught. Occam's Razor states that "entities should not be multiplied without necessity", in short that the simplest explanation is usually the right one.

In 3 Nephi, Jesus instructed the disciples how to pray and it mentions that he was pleased with them for the manner of their prayer:

<Scripture
  title="3 Nephi 19:24"

>
  24 And it came to pass that when Jesus had thus prayed unto the Father, he came unto his
  disciples, and behold, they did still continue, without ceasing, to pray unto him; and{' '}
  <b>they did not multiply many words</b>, for it was given unto them what they should pray, and
  they were filled with desire.
</Scripture>

## God works with simple means

Alma 37 teaches how God brings about great works through simple means:

<Scripture
  title="Alma 37:6-7"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng"
>
  6 Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and
  simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound
  the wise.
  <br />7 And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very
  small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.
</Scripture>

If simple things can change my life in meaningful ways, and Jesus is even fond of simplicity, ideas should prefer simplicity. It's okay to move into concepts that are less simple, but simple concepts that build into them should be understood first for it to be a meaningful pursuit.

## Simplicity in writing

Simple ideas and simple writing can be more powerful than flowery works that dance around an idea. [Paul Graham writes about this](http://paulgraham.com/simply.html) and I think it makes sense to try and keep my writing in mediums—like these notes—simple.
