  30 I tell you these things because of your prayers; wherefore, treasure up wisdom in your bosoms,
  lest the wickedness of men reveal these things unto you by their wickedness, in a manner which
  shall speak in your ears with a voice louder than that which shall shake the earth; but{' '}
  <b>if ye are prepared ye shall not fear.</b>
</Scripture>
