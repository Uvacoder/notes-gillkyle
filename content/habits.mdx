Forming positive habits is harder than letting negative habits gain traction. It takes being [[intentional]] to choose exactly habits to pluck out and replace with better behaviors.

Some of my positive habits I plan on being accountable for continuing are:

- reading my scriptures every day (>15 min)
- praying every morning and night
- writing in my journal each night (as part of my [[nightly routine]])

Some habits I'd like to remove:

- chewing my fingernails
- using filler words like "like" and "um"
- (feel free to submit your own ðŸ˜…)
