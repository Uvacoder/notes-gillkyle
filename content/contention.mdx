title: 'Contention'
---

Contention is divisive and contrary to divinity. While studying I came across this passage:

<Scripture
  title="JSH 1:6"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.6?lang=eng"
>
  6 ...yet when the converts began to file off, some to one party and some to another, it was seen
  that the seemingly good feelings of both the priests and the converts were more pretended than
  real; for a scene of great confusion and bad feeling ensuedâ€”priest contending against priest, and
  convert against convert; so that{' '}
  <b>
    all their good feelings one for another, if they ever had any, were entirely lost in a strife of
    words and a contest about opinions.
  </b>
</Scripture>

This led me to [[Jesus]]' words to the Nephites in 3 Nephi 11:

<Scripture
  title="3 Nephi 11:29-30"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/11.29-30?lang=eng"
>
  29 For verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is
  of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend
  with anger, one with another.
  <br />
  30 Behold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another;
  but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.
</Scripture>

Contention doesn't solve problems. It is not to say that things like disagreement are bad, but that anger that seeks to tear down won't lead to positive outcomes.
