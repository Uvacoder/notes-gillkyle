Faith is the first principle of the [[Gospel of Jesus Christ]].

There's an interesting quote that relates faith to knowledge in the Bible Dictionary:

<Scripture
  title="Bible Dictionary: Faith"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/faith?lang=eng"
>
  All true faith must be based upon correct knowledge or it cannot produce the desired results.
</Scripture>

Even preemptive to the foundational building block of the Gospel is gaining a correct knowledge of truth.
